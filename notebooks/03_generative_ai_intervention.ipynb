    "Phase 3: Business Heuristics & Generative AI Intervention\n",
    "After our investigation in Phase 2, we discovered the \"Cold Start Problem\": it is nearly impossible to predict exam failure with high precision 14 or 7 days before the deadline because behavioral signals are not yet active (most students are dormant).\n",
    "The Pivot: Instead of chasing a low-precision prediction, we apply the Reciprocal Heuristic: In education, the absence of evidence of progress is evidence of risk.\n",
    "The Strategy: We segment students into three zones:\n",
    "- Safe Zone (Green): Progress > 10%. (Action: None).\n",
    "- Warning Zone (Yellow): Progress 1-9%. (Action: Low-cost nudge).\n",
    "- Dormant Zone (Red): Progress == 0%. (Action: GenAI Intervention).\n",
    "This notebook focuses on the Dormant Zone. We will use Google Gemini to generate hyper-personalized \"re-engagement\" plans for students with zero activity, helping them break their procrastination before it's too late."

      "I know exactly how it feels when a deadline starts to loom. That \"paralysis\" usually happens because the mountain looks too big to climb, so it feels easier not to start at all. But at EnkelEksamen, we specialize in helping students succeed even when time is tight. \n",

      "\n",
      "**Step 2: Identify the \"Big Wins\" (Next 24 Hours)**\n",
      "Skip the minor details for now. Look at the course overview and pick the **three most important topics** (the ones that always show up on exams). Focus your energy there first. Getting these under your belt will give you a massive confidence boost.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Step 3: The 25-Minute Sprint (Next 48 Hours)**\n",
      "Set a timer on your phone for 25 minutes. Study until it goes off, then stop. Doing one short, focused session is infinitely better than planning a 5-hour session that never happens.\n",
